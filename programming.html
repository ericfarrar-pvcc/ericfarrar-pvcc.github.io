                            Code review: Confirming that new and modified software is following an organizationâ€™s coding standards and adheres to its best practices.</li><li>Integration testing: Ensuring that software components or functions operate together.</li><li>Unit testing: Validating that each software unit runs as expected. A unit is the smallest testable component of an application.</li><li>Functional testing: Checking functions by emulating business scenarios, based on functional requirements. Black-box testing is a common way to verify functions.</li><li>Performance testing: Testing how the software runs under different workloads. Load testing, for example, is used to evaluate performance under real-life load conditions.</li><li>Regression testing: Checking whether new features break or degrade functionality. Sanity testing can be used to verify menus, functions and commands at the surface level, when there is no time for a full regression test.</li><li>Stress testing: Testing how much strain the system can take before it fails. Stress testing is considered to be a type of non-functional testing.</li><li>Usability testing: Validating how well a customer can use a system or web application to complete a task.</li></ul></li>
                       <li>Software testing is done to detect: <ul><li>Architectural flaws</li><li>Poor design decisions</li><li>Invalid or incorrect functionality</li><li>Security vulnerabilities</li><li>Scalabilty issues</li></ul></li>
                       <li>Testing best Practices:<ul><li>Continous testing: enables software to be validated in realistic test environments earlier in the process, which improves design and reduces risks. test each build as it becomes available.</li>Configuration managment: Organizations centrally maintain test assets and track what software builds to test. Teams can access assets easily<li><li>Service vitalization: simulates the services and systems that are missing or not yet completed, enabling teams to reduce dependencies and test sooner. </li><li>Defect or bug tracking: Automated tools allow teams to track defects, measure their scope and impact, and uncover related issues.</li><li>Metrics and reporting: Reporting and analytics enable team members to share status, goals and test results.</li></ul></li>
